                <h3>Treatment To Be Done</h3>
                <p>I understand and consent to have any treatment done by the dentist after the procedure, the risks &
                    benefits & cost have been fully explained. These treatments include, but are not limited to, x-rays,
                    cleanings, periodontal treatments, fillings, crowns, bridges, all types of extraction, root canals, &/or
                    dentures, local anesthetics & surgical cases.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Drugs & Medications</h3>
                <p>I understand that antibiotics, analgesics & other medications can cause allergic reactions like redness &
                    swelling of tissues, pain, itching, vomiting, &/or anaphylactic shock.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Changes in Treatment Plan</h3>
                <p>I understand that during treatment it may be necessary to change/add procedures because of conditions
                    found while working on the teeth that were not discovered during the examination. For example, root
                    canal therapy may be needed following routine restorative procedures. I give my permission to the
                    dentist to make any/all changes and additions as necessary with my responsibility to pay all the costs
                    agreed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Radiograph</h3>
                <p>I understand that an x-ray shot or a radiograph may be necessary as part of a diagnostic aid to come up
                    with a tentative diagnosis of my dental problem and to make a good treatment plan, but this will not
                    give me a 100% assurance for the accuracy of the treatment since all dental treatments are subject to
                    unpredictable complications that later on may lead to sudden change of treatment plan and subject to new
                    charges. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h4>Removal of Teeth</h4>
                <p>I understand that alternatives to tooth removal (root canal therapy, crowns & periodontal surgery, etc.)
                    & I completely understand these alternatives, including their risks & benefits prior to authorizing the
                    dentist to remove teeth & any other structures necessary for reasons above. I understand that removing
                    teeth does not always remove all the infections, if present, & it may be necessary to have further
                    treatment. I understand the risks involved in having teeth removed, such as pain, swelling, spread of
                    infection, dry socket, fractured jaw, loss of feeling on the teeth, lips, tongue & surrounding tissue
                    that can last for an indefinite period of time. I understand that I may need further treatment under a
                    specialist if complications arise during or following treatment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h4>Crowns (Caps) & Bridges</h4>
                <p>Preparing a tooth may irritate the nerve tissue in the center of the tooth, leaving the tooth extra
                    sensitive to heat, cold & pressure. Treating such irritation may involve using special toothpastes,
                    mouth rinses, or root canal therapy. I understand that sometimes it is not possible to match the color
                    of natural teeth exactly with artificial teeth. I further understand that I may be wearing temporary
                    crowns, which may come off easily & that I must be careful to ensure that they are kept on until the
                    permanent crowns are delivered. It is my responsibility to return for permanent cementation within 20
                    days from tooth preparation, as excessive delay may allow for tooth movement, which may necessitate a
                    remake of the crown, bridge, or cap. I understand there will be additional charges for remakes due to my
                    delaying of permanent cementation, & I realize that final opportunity to make changes in my new crown,
                    bridges, or cap (including shape, fit, size, & color) will be before permanent cementation.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="section">
                <h4>Endodontics (Root Canal)</h4>
                <p>I understand there is no guarantee that a root canal treatment will save a tooth & that complications can
                    occur from the treatment & that occasionally root canal filling materials may extend through the tooth
                    which does not necessarily affect the success of the treatment. I understand that endodontic files &
                    drills are very fine instruments & stresses vented in their manufacture & calcifications present in
                    teeth can cause them to break during use. I understand that referral to the endodontist for additional
                    treatments may be necessary following any root canal treatment & I agree that I am responsible for any
                    additional cost for treatment performed by the endodontist. I understand that a tooth may require
                    removal in spite of all efforts to save it. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h4>Periodontal Disease</h4>
                <p>I understand that periodontal disease is a serious condition causing gum & bone inflammation &/or loss &
                    that can lead eventually to the loss of my teeth. I understand the alternative treatment plans to
                    correct periodontal disease, including gum surgery, tooth extractions with or without replacement. I
                    understand that undertaking any dental procedures may have future adverse effects on my periodontal
                    conditions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h4>Fillings</h4>
                <p>I understand that care must be exercised in chewing on fillings, especially during the first 24 hours to
                    avoid breakage. I understand that a more extensive filling or a crown may be required, as additional
                    decay or fracture may become evident after initial excavation. I understand that significant sensitivity
                    is a common, but usually temporary, after-effect of a newly placed filling. I further understand that
                    filling a tooth may irritate the nerve tissue creating sensitivity & treating such sensitivity could
                    require root canal therapy or extractions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h4>Dentures</h4>
                <p>I understand that wearing of dentures can be difficult. Sore spots, altered speech & difficulty in eating
                    are common problems. Immediate dentures (placement of denture immediately after extractions) may be
                    painful. Immediate dentures may require considerable adjusting & several relines. I understand that it
                    is my responsibility to return for delivery of dentures. I understand that failure to keep my delivery
                    appointment may result in poorly fitted dentures. If a remake is required due to my delays of more than
                    30 days, there will be additional charges. A permanent reline will be needed later, which is not
                    included in the initial fee. I understand that all adjustment or alterations of any kind after this
                    initial period is subject to charges.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h4>General Understanding</h4>
                <p>I understand that dentistry is not an exact science and that no dentist can properly guarantee accurate
                    results all the time. I hereby authorize any of the doctors/dental auxiliaries to proceed with & perform
                    the dental restorations & treatments as explained to me. I understand that these are subject to
                    modification depending on undiagnosable circumstances that may arise during the course of treatment. I
                    understand that regardless of any dental insurance coverage I may have, I am responsible for payment of
                    dental fees. I agree to pay any attorney's fees, collection fees, or court costs that may be incurred to
                    satisfy any obligation to this office. All treatments were properly explained to me & any untoward
                    circumstances that may arise during the procedure, the attending dentist will not be held liable since
                    it is my free will, with full trust & confidence in him/her, to undergo dental treatment under his/her
                    care.</p>
